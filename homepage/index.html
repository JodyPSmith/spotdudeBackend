        <p>Do you ever find yourself getting home from the store and realizing you've forgotten to pick up the one item you initially went for? Do you ever wish you could leave a recommendation for your friends about a fun little store they might like if they're in the area?</p>
        <p>Spot lets you easily create lists and link them to a location so that when you or your friends are in the area you can get notified of something you had to do or might be fun to check out. Spot is is a combined reminder and social discovery app </p>
